Smart To-Do Manager is a lightweight and user-friendly task management web application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and manage
multiple task lists, add tasks with due date and time, mark tasks as completed, edit or delete tasks. 
The project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout, and strong front-end fundamentals without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.
